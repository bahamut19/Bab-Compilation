# The Testament of the Honored Primal Point {#sec-the-testament-of-the-honored-primal-point .unnumbered}

The Testament of the honored Primal Point—may the spirit of all else be offered up for Him:

O Name of the Eternal, bear witness that there is no God but I, the Mighty, the Beloved. Then bear witness that there is no God but I, God, the All-Pervading, the Everlasting. God has created all that was brought forth from the First who has no beginning, and all that shall be created until the Last who has no end, for the Manifestation of His Self. This is the command of God for whoever has been and shall be created by Him: the Manifestation of His Self in every thing as He wills, by His command. Indeed, He is the All-Knowing, the Wise.

When one is cut off from that Throne, he recites from the verses of God whatever God casts into his heart as a remembrance from Him. Truly, He is the All-Pervading, the Everlasting. Recite on My behalf each night and day, then for the servants of God who believe: “Truly, I am God—there is no God but I, the All-Knowing, the Powerful. And if you so desire, I am God—there is no God but I, the Sovereign, the Inaccessible."

Bear witness that I am alive in the Most Glorious Horizon. I hear everyone who remembers Me, and indeed I am the best of those who remember. Whoever stands before the Throne of your Lord, it is as though he stands before God, the All-Pervading, the Everlasting, and there is no greater reward for what he has endured if he is among those who are certain. Then bear witness that God is Subtle, above every subtlety. He loves to behold upon the Throne that which has spoken of His Most Glorious Lord regarding all that was brought into being by His permission. Indeed, He is the most generous of the generous. God loves that they enclose these within crystal containers, then conceal those containers within stones, which in their utmost refinement were created so that all may bring them forth. This is what God has desired for those who believe in God and His signs, if you are able. Say: “cotton, then silk containers, then whatever you can.”

From the sweetest stone—and if, after some days, you can reveal it to those who are alive so their hearts do not become distressed and they may rejoice. Present yourself before God in the state you are in, among those who are capable, and convey the command of your Lord to all the worlds. Turn to what was sent down in the Bayán with an exalted measure of might, and speak with goodness to all who have believed in Me, then in My words, so that they do not differ concerning the Cause of God, for they are far from the path. If God brings forth in your days someone like you, this is the inheritance of the Cause from God, the One, the Peerless. If He does not bring forth such a one, then be certain that God did not will to make Himself known. Entrust then the Cause to God, your Lord and the Lord of all the worlds, and command the witnesses who are mindful of God in their faith and do not transgress His bounds.

Indeed, whoever is near your Lord has taught us gems of knowledge and wisdom—seek them out, for We have indeed been those who inform. Then bring forth from them, by your Lord’s leave, whatever you are able through your power. Know that the doors of the Bayán have been determined by the number of all things, yet We have revealed only eleven for each single Temple of the Nine Temples before the tenth—eleven times one—this is a mention from God, the Most Exalted, the Most Great. It is a mention of grace, otherwise, all belong to God and all return unto Him. Then you must command the One Whom God shall make manifest, for He shall come in the next Resurrection with a sublime and mighty authority. Truly, all of us are servants of God, and all bow down before Him. He does whatever He wills by permission of His Lord; none are to question Him about what He does, while all shall be questioned concerning everything.

If God reveals His might in your days, then by His leave make manifest the ways of the Eight, according to the capability you possess—indeed, He is the most bountiful of the bountiful. We promised those who bear the Throne of your Lord a single path, whenever the decree descends from them, for We have always been faithful to what God has pledged. God does not fail in His promise; truly, He is the truest of the true. And if God does not reveal His might in your days, then be patient with what has been sent down, and do not alter even one letter, for that is God’s decree in a mighty Book. Command what has been sent down, and do not change a single thing, so that the people may not differ in the religion of God. They were intended to remain on one path until another Resurrection, nurtured accordingly. Recall everything We have mentioned in your Book, for We indeed have remembered. From among the traces of God, seven shall be brought to you—for We have apportioned them. Take one for yourself; then give each one to those in the lands of Fá, Ayn, Khá, Alif, Mím, and Káf, who are servants of God and believers.

Whoever was the first among them in a mighty Book shall convey to you what God, your Lord, wills to be sealed; so seal it, then multiply its like in all the worlds. And everything that name conveys from Us is indeed from Us; so be of those who abide by it. Guard yourself, then guard yourself again, and then guard what was sent down in the Bayán, and then whatever is sent down by you. This shall remain until the Day of Resurrection, and every believer shall benefit from it. Whoever is in the land of Fá shall convey to the Most High Name of God, so that each one who first received My love may receive a mention from God, the Most Exalted, the Most Great, in the land of Ayn—to the name of the noble one who assisted God with all that he possessed on the Day of Resurrection, and before God he attained a mighty station.

We have now raised up those who carried out the limit of their fifth share in the Bayán, along with their descendants, as a favor from Us—truly, We have ever been gracious. In the land of Khá, there is a link to the name Ṣaddāq-i Ṣadīq. In the land of Alif, there is a link to the name of the Mighty, the Merciful. In the land of Mím dwell those who are among the certain. In the land of Káf, one finds a link to the name of your Lord—the Generous, the Bestower, the Most Bountiful. It is not permitted for anyone to own more than one, and in that they all rejoice. Whatever writings of God, the All-Pervading, the Everlasting, exist along with the tablets, guard them, and give them only to the sincere servants of God; for one among them is so precious that the creation of the heavens and the earth and all between them would not compare, if one is truly aware. Seek refuge in God from every oppressor, until God brings forth from His presence what makes them rejoice. Say: He is the Conqueror above His creation; He is the All-Pervading, the Everlasting.

If the Name of Security belongs among the certain, transmit from the Greatest Temples the oneness of God so that He may aid you in God’s religion with whatever you possess of power. We have made the Divider of the Tablets the one who writes down God’s verses, so that he may convey their most resplendent form to the Most High Unique One. Then he takes for himself a Greatest Temple, and goes to each rightful one to give them their due—those who await, by God’s leave.

The above blessed testament was transcribed exactly from an ancient manuscript, without omission or addition of even a dot, prepared and compared with utmost care under the mandate for the revival of the Blessed Lotus by its present custodian, Siyyid Ḥabíbulláh Afnání ‘Alá’í—may my spirit be offered up for him—and completed on the night of Kh… the 14th day of the month of Núr in the year 100 of the Badí‘ calendar.
