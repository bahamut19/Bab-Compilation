# BB00079 (Epistle to Muhammad Shah 3) {#sec-bb00079 .unnumbered}

He is the Most Exalted, the Most High. Praise and thanks, beyond compare or measure, befit the Divine Self-Subsisting One, who has ever existed, while no thing has been in the sanctified realm of His majesty, and who remains, in the transcendent snow-white loftiness of His eternal essence—nothing in the pure realm of being is with Him. God is just as He ever was. I bear witness that there is no God but He, no likeness unto Him; He is the Most High, the Most Great.

I bear witness that our description of possible things in His presence is sheer falsehood and utter nothingness, and that as He is in Himself, no one shall ever know Him, nor can any servant truly affirm His oneness. That is impossible within the realm of possibility, for whatever is deemed possible in His knowledge is created within His dominion. He has always been known by His own Self, with no other existing to know Him. And that which comes into being by His calling it forth—out of nothing—and that which is realized by His bringing it about—not from anything—stands named in the domain of its arising and present in the bounds of its limitations. Yet before its Maker, it remains sheer nothingness and absolute extinction, no different from before its creation. Indeed, God is far too exalted to be known by another or described by any besides Himself. Glorified art Thou.
