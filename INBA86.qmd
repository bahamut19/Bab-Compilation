## Vahid 1

**Page 1**\
**The First One**\
In the Name of God, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Holy

Indeed, I am God; there is no god but Me. Verily, all besides Me are My creation. Say: O My creation, worship Me alone! I have created you, provided for you, caused you to die and brought you to life, raised you up, and made you the Manifestation of My Self, that you may recite My verses revealed from Me and call all whom I have created to My religion. This is the path of mighty glory.

I have created all things for you and have made you, by Our decree, a sovereign over the worlds. I have permitted those who enter My religion to do so through their recognition of My oneness, and I have joined their faith with your remembrance. Then remind those whom I have made the Letters of Truth by My leave, and proclaim what I have revealed in the Bayan of My religion. For through this, My sincere servants shall attain My good pleasure.

Verily, the sun is a sign from Me, that in every manifestation, its rising may be witnessed by all My believing servants. I have created you through yourself, and all things through your command, by an authority from Us. Indeed, We are powerful.

I have made you the First and the Last, the Manifest and the Hidden. Verily, We are knowing. No religion has been sent down but through you, and no book has been revealed but upon you. No one shall be raised up for a religion but you, and no book shall be sent down but upon you. This is the decree of the All-Possessing, the Beloved.

**Page 2**

Verily, the Bayan is Our proof over all things; none among the worlds is capable of producing its verses. These are all Our signs from before and after, just as you were then the entirety of Our proof. We admit whomsoever We will into the gardens of a great holiness. This is what We initiate in every manifestation of the command—a decree from Us. Indeed, We are sovereign.

No religion do We establish but that which will give rise to a new creation thereafter. A promise binding upon Us—indeed, We are dominant over all things. We have appointed the gates of this religion to be as numerous as all things, like the number of years, each day a gate, so that all things may enter the Supreme Paradise, and so that, in each number, one may be engaged in the remembrance of a letter from the primal Letters—for God is the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth, the Lord of all things, the Lord of what is seen and what is unseen, the Lord of all the worlds.

We have set forth, in the first gate, what God has testified regarding His own Self—that there is no god but He, the Lord of all things, and that all besides Him are His creation, and that all worship Him. Verily, the Essence of the Seven Letters is the Gate of God for those in the dominion of the heavens, the earth, and all that is between them. All are guided by the signs of God revealed from Him.

Then, in every gate, there is the mention of a true Name from Us and the remembrance of one of the Letters of the Living, in accordance with their return to life.

Here is the translation according to your instructions:

**Page 3**

The First: **Muhammad is the Messenger of God**, and those who are witnesses from God, then the Gates of Guidance. They were created in the next creation according to what God promised in the Qur’an, until the number of the One appears in the First One—out of a bounty from Us. Indeed, We are bountiful. This is the First One from the numbered One.

We declare in the month of Bahá that We initiated this creation through Him, and indeed, We shall bring all things back through Him—a promise binding upon Us. Indeed, We are powerful over all things.

I have reckoned the numbers by that One, for after this, they shall no longer be counted, and before this, the Letters of the One were not completed in the first sign. They were present, with their hearts drawn near before Us, and nothing was seen therein except the One without number. Thus does God clarify the measures of all things in the Book, so that people may give thanks in the days of their Lord.

A pure essence, transcendent—this One, who is God, Mighty and Glorious, has always existed and will always be in the heights of pre-eternity and the loftiness of His primordial existence. The creation, too, has always remained in its domain of possibility. And in every age, God—Exalted and Glorious—has decreed a Book and a Proof for the people.

In the year **1270 AH** from the mission of Muhammad, the Messenger of God, He ordained the **Bayán** as the Book and established the **Essence of the Seven Letters** as the Proof, while appointing the Gates of the Religion as the number **nineteen**—one unit.

**Page 4**

In the First Unity (**Wáḥid**), He established the decree concerning the oneness of Essence, Attributes, Actions, and Worship. He appointed as the proof of this Gate **"He whom God shall make manifest"** and the **Letters of the Living**.

Before His manifestation, the **Essence of the Seven Letters** was established, along with His Letters, who were foremost in recognizing the oneness of God.

This **One** is precisely the same as the **One of the Qur’an**, manifest in the outward and inward, the first and the last.

The proof that follows is identical to the proof that preceded, which was the **Furqán (the Criterion, i.e., the Qur’an)**—the difference being that over **1,270 years**, the words have advanced along with their spirits.

In every manifestation, the decree of the **Hereafter** applies relative to the previous manifestation.

Thus, in this revelation, the rank of **"the Greatest Magnification"** has not yet appeared from the final Name, **"the Wise"**, which was the **Essence of the Seven Letters**.

By the number **eight**, the **"Mirror of God"** has remained in its station, such that due to the intensity of the fire of love, none had the power to draw near.

The **sign of the Sun of Oneness** has been fulfilled in **Oneness itself**.

Whoever recites the verse:\
*"God has borne witness that there is no god but Him, the Almighty, the Beloved! To Him belong the Most Beautiful Names. All who are in the heavens and the earth and all that is between them glorify Him. There is no god but He, the Living."*

Here is the translation according to your instructions:

**Page 5**

Let him recite **"the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting"**, and then say:\
*"O God, send blessings upon the Essence of the Seven Letters, then upon the Letters of the Living, with might and majesty. I have believed in this One."*

## Vahid 2

**The Second One**\
In the Name of God, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Holy

O **Letter R** and **Letter B**, bear witness that there is no god but Me!

I have sent down in the **First Gate** of the **Second One**: Recognize the power of your Lord in the signs. Then bear witness to a remembrance that is infinite in all things.

Mankind has failed to grasp what has been revealed in the **Bayán**—yet through it, you shall affirm whatever you desire.

Then, in the **Second Gate**, none has comprehended the knowledge of the **Bayán** except you, at the end of your days, and those who testify to what I have willed therein—these are the victorious ones.

Then, in the **Third Gate**, I have permitted no one to interpret anything except by what I have interpreted. Say: *All goodness returns to Me, and apart from this, to the Letters of Negation.*

This is the knowledge of the **Bayán**, if you truly understand.

Then, goodness shall be remembered down to the smallest particles in the knowledge of the reverent.

Then, what is lesser than goodness shall be known down to the smallest particles, bearing witness apart from the sincere ones.

Recite the **First Verse**, if you are capable!

Thus, all matters shall be made clear, if you truly know.

**Page 6**

That is the **Most Holy Name** in the final return, if you bear witness.

This is **"He whom God shall make manifest"**—if God wills, you shall be certain of it.

Then, in the **Fourth Gate**, *We have neglected nothing in the Book*—if you believe in **Him whom God shall make manifest**.

Then, in the **Fifth Gate**, whatever has been revealed in the **Bayán**, even a single letter, has a spirit within it. You grieve in the knowledge of remoteness, yet you rejoice in the knowledge of nearness.

If you recite **negation**, it will annihilate them—this is what bears fruit in the presence of God, if you perceive.

And if you recite **affirmation**, it will establish Him—this is what bears fruit in the presence of God, if you are able.

Indeed, the **First** is the **Essence**—by God's permission, you draw near. All letters return to these two, if you have insight.

Do not merely say, *"There is no god but God,"* while you remain blind to the **Throne of the Light of Affirmation**.

God has removed this blindness from you, and this is the **Good Pleasure of God** for those brought near.

Then, in the **Sixth Gate**, We have revealed **no mention of goodness in the Bayán** except for the one We shall manifest on the Day of Resurrection, through My signs—perhaps you will aid Him.

There is no mention apart from goodness except for one who refuses to prostrate before Him—such a one shall be made among the prostrators.

Thus did We reveal the **Qur'an** in times past, yet you were veiled from My Will.

This is what the **Eightfold Unity** has revolved around throughout **day and night**, and you are unified in worship through it.

Here is the translation according to your instructions:

**Page 7**

And you were veiled from its secret after it had been decreed.

This is the **Balance of Guidance** in the **Bayán**—you believe in it until the time when the **Sun of the Most High** arises.

This is **He whom God shall make manifest**—if you act in accordance with Him, you will believe, and you will abide in **Ridwán** forever. Otherwise, you will perish.

Then, the **Seventh**: *The Day of Resurrection*—as you perceive it—from the first rising of the **Sun of Bahá** until it sets.

Goodness is in the **Book of God**, beyond all that is in the night—if you perceive.

God has created nothing except for that Day, for all shall act for the sake of **meeting God** and attaining His good pleasure.

On the **Day of Resurrection**, this will be made manifest—so observe, for indeed, We have been waiting.

Let your actions be for the sake of God.

The moment of **decline** draws near, yet you do not recognize that **Day**.

Whoever attains the **meeting** of **His Essence** has truly met Me.

Do not be satisfied with anything for another that you would not be satisfied with for yourself.

Remember the **final Letter**, then act within your limits.

Then, the **Eighth**: **Death has been decreed for all things** at My manifestation, apart from those who love Me.

That which I initiate from My command is what will benefit you, and it will bring you forth from the **fire** to the **light**.

This is the **Supreme Horizon**, if you perceive.

This is **death within life**, and it is the truth, beyond doubt.

The **death of the body** is like this **death**—

**Page 8**

If you grasp both in **life**, you will understand.

Then, the **Ninth**: The **Letter S** is the **grave** of all who have believed in Him on the **Day of Resurrection**—all shall be raised up.

Say: *This is the truth, beyond doubt!*

Through the words of the **Point**, this raising shall take place—this is the decree of the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting.

Then, the **Tenth**: The **servant is questioned** about **Him who shall appear**—this is what is asked in the grave, if you answer in truth.

This is the **saying of the angel from God**, if you are certain in the signs of God.

These are the signs of **Him whom God shall make manifest**.

Then, the **shadow of the Ninth** is like the **shadow of the Tenth**—through it, you find guidance.

Then, the **One after Ten**: *The resurrection is like the grave*—it is truth.

God raises whomever He wills from among the living souls of His creation through the decree of the **Manifestation of His Self**.

Thus, on the **Day of Resurrection**, you shall be raised by the speech of **Him whom God shall make manifest**.

Then, the **Second after Ten**: The **mention of the Path**—this is truth, and you shall traverse it.

This is the decree of **Him whom God shall make manifest**—if, on the **Day of Manifestation**, you act upon it.

Say: *All who came before awaited My Day.*

When I appear, their **religion** shall be confirmed by what I bring.

At the **Path**, all shall stand still—

This is their silence in **truth**, if you perceive.

Then, the **Third after Ten**: The **mention of the Balance**—

This is **the very essence of Him whom God shall make manifest**.

The **truth** moves with Him, just as the **shadow moves with the sun**.

Thus, after the **sun has set**, you shall weigh everything by the **Bayán** and the **witnesses**.

Here is the translation according to your instructions:

**Page 9**

Then, the **Fourth after Ten**: The **mention of Reckoning**, like the Balance—this is the truth.

Everything revealed in the **Bayán**—by it, God shall bring all people and all things to account.

O My servants, then fear Me!

Then, the **Fifth after Ten**: The **Book is the truth**—this is the word of God from My tongue, if you are truly certain.

Then, the **Sixth after Ten**: **Paradise is the love of God, then His good pleasure**—this is truth, beyond comparison.

Indeed, We abide therein forever.

Whatever is attributed to Me in Paradise shall be attributed to **Him whom God shall make manifest**—will you not then enter?

Before **the fire is transformed into light**, it is the **fire of God**—this is **Him whom God shall make manifest**, before He makes Himself known to you.

You shall enter the **fire of love**, and this is truth, without equal.

If you enter it, then you shall attain all goodness.

Then, the **Seventh after Ten**: The **mention of Fire**—I do not love the mention of those who do not believe in **Him whom God shall make manifest**.

Whoever does not believe in Him is attributed to the **fire**.

O My servants, beware!

Then, the **Eighth after Ten**: The **Hour**—you shall be certain when God wills, through what He has explained in the **Word**.

Then, the **Ninth after Ten**: What God has revealed in the **Bayán** is a **garden of might** for **Him whom We shall manifest**—perhaps you will believe in His signs.

## Vahid 3

**The Third One**\
In the Name of God, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Holy

**Page 10**

Indeed, I am God—there is no god but Me.

All besides Me, if they are guided by My guidance, are like a mirror in which the **sun of your rising** is reflected—this is My creation.

Say: *O My creation, fear Me alone!*

The **First in the Third One**: Whatever you are certain of, and whatever **name** is mentioned, belongs to Me.

Whatever **I have not taken possession of**, I still possess.

Say: *O My creation, at the appearance of the Hereafter, recognize My dominion, then take possession through Me!*

Then, the **Second**: Whatever I utter is truth—through it, I create whatever I will.

If it is truth, then it is truth.

If it is beyond truth, then it is beyond truth.

This is what We utter—every **negation** and **affirmation** has come into being, and then appeared through what We utter.

Say: *O My servants, fear Me!*

Then, the **Third**: If We manifest you on the **Day of Resurrection**, through what I have sent forth before,

We shall **abrogate what was previously revealed**, whenever We so permit.

Indeed, We have been patient.

Then, the **Fourth**: What We reveal to you in **your latter days** is greater than what We revealed to you in **former times**—so be among the grateful!

My bounty in what We reveal to you now is greater than what We revealed to you before, just as the **Qur'an surpasses the Gospel**.

This is the **favor of Muhammad over Jesus**.

Say: *O My servants, My appearance is at the end—what do you await?*

Then, the **Fifth**: The **graves of the One** shall be raised when permission is granted on the **Day of My Manifestation**.

Through **My word**, they were raised before.

Say: *O My servants, to Me shall you return!*

Then, the **Sixth**: Whatever **name** is mentioned apart from God, it belongs to **Him**—between them there is nothing.

Here is the translation according to your instructions:

**Page 11**

**Thirdly**, say: *Indeed, I am the Truth, and all besides Me have been created through Me, then for Me.*

O My servants, in My final appearance, you shall perceive Me.

Then, the **Seventh**: My creation shall never comprehend Me in order to see Me.

All that I have revealed concerning the mention of **meeting Me** pertains to **you** in your **latter days** as well as in your **former days**.

Say: *This is the greatest of the gardens, if, after recognizing it, you perceive!*

Say: *Do not look upon anything in My Paradise except that you discern therein My good pleasure.*

O My lovers, gaze upon **Him whom We shall manifest in truth**!

Then, the **Eighth**: All things created in the **Bayán**—you gaze upon them.

Then, the **Ninth**: Whatever is revealed in the **Bayán** has descended upon the **temples of the One**—you recite that **verse**:

*"God has borne witness that there is no god but Him, the All-Merciful, the Lord of the Mighty Throne. There is no god but Him, the Almighty, the Self-Subsisting. There is no god but Him, the Sovereign, the Supreme Ruler, the Overpowering, the Manifest, the Incomparable, the Transcendent. To Him belong the Most Beautiful Names. All who are in the heavens and the earth and all that is between them glorify Him."*

Say: *Glory be to God beyond what you attribute to Him!*

*"God—there is no god but Him—the Truth, the All-Knowing, the Sustainer, the All-Powerful. To Him belong the Most Beautiful Names. All in the heavens and the earth and all that is between them prostrate before Him. He is the Almighty, the Beloved."*

Then, the **Tenth**: Within it is that **verse**—you are the number of all things.

If you **find the spirit and the fragrance**, you shall recite.

Otherwise, you shall **fall silent** and then reflect.

**God has borne witness**—

**Page 12**

*"God has borne witness that there is no god but Him. To Him belong creation and command. He gives life and causes death, then causes death and gives life. Indeed, He is the Living, Who does not die. In His grasp is the dominion of all things. He creates whatever He wills by His command. He is powerful over all things."*

Then, the **First after Ten**: Whatever has been revealed within it, in the **First Verse**, begins with:

*"In the Name of God, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Holy."*

You gaze upon the **Letters of the One**.

Then, the **Second after Ten**: What is within it, in the **Point**—you comprehend the **First Letter**.

This is **Him whom God shall make manifest**.

The **Letters of the Living** are to Him as mirrors are to the sun.

Likewise, in all **Names and Attributes**, you find guidance.

This is the **essence of the Bayán**—it speaks of itself from its **Lord**.

What do you remember of Him?

*"Indeed, I am God—there is no god but Me!"*

To God belongs **manifest sovereignty**.

Say: *All besides Me are My creation—all worship Me alone!*

Say: *God, God is my Lord!*

And you, O all things, **do not associate anything with God, your Lord**!

Do not call upon anything alongside God, your Lord, the All-Merciful!

Then, the **Third after Ten**: **Ask not concerning My past or My future**, except what is in the **Book**.

You shall come to know every **One** in your paths—perhaps you will act with propriety.

Then, the **Fourth after Ten**: Preserve **all that has been revealed in the Bayán**, as if it were a **piece of embroidery woven into scattered tablets**.

Do not write anything that **alters its design**.

Then, keep it safeguarded **on the highest part of the parchment**.

Whoever holds a **letter** less than what befits **His might**, his **deeds shall be veiled**—so do not be among them!

Here is the translation according to your instructions:

**Page 13**

The **veiled ones**—

Then, the **Fifth after Ten**: If you believe in **Him whom We shall manifest on the Day of Resurrection**,

then indeed, through Me and My signs, you have been believers in all the worlds.

Otherwise, seek His forgiveness, and turn to Him in repentance.

Then, the **Sixth after Ten**: Do not act except according to what We have revealed to you,

and do not command except by it.

Say: *He is the Sun, making you and your traces like mirrors, in which you behold all that you love.*

Thus, you shall truly encounter the **truth**.

Then, the **Seventh after Ten**: Do not inscribe My traces except in the most **excellent script**,

to the extent that you are capable.

Whoever holds a letter **written in anything less than the most exalted script**, his deeds shall be nullified—except for children, as they are still learning proper conduct.

Then, the **Eighth after Ten**: Whoever composes the **words of God**, say:

*"Choose for yourself the most refined script, then grant it to whomever you will, for that is the firm and true balance."*

Then, the **Ninth after Ten**: *O My servants, remove your concerns for dominion in what has been revealed to Me,*

to the extent that you are capable.

If you find someone whose script possesses the **radiance of beauty**, like **the earth and all that is upon it**, then seek him out,

until he writes My name—the **Almighty, the Self-Subsisting**.

Whatever you are commanded to **write in the highest form of script**, do so only so that you may be counted among the **spirits of the letters**.

This is your **lineage**, so combine both beauties, and be thankful to Me!

## Vahid 4

**Page 14**

**The Fourth One**

**In the Name of God, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Holy**

Indeed, **I am God—there is no god but Me, the Most Supreme, the Most Supreme!**

I have created you and granted you **two stations**.

**This is My station—none shall be seen within it but Me.**

And from this, you shall speak on My behalf:

*"Indeed, I am God—there is no god but Me, the Lord of all the worlds!"*

From this, you shall seek My bounty, praise Me, affirm My oneness, and worship Me,

that you may be among those who prostrate before Me.

This is the **First One of the Fourth**.

Then, in the **Second**: Say, *Whatever returns to Me, returns to God, my Lord, and whatever does not return to Me shall never return to God.*

Then, all matters shall return to **His decree**.

Then, in the **Third**: I shall not **worship** in the manner that you **worship Me**, by **alteration**—

for this is **the essence of your alteration** in both your **latter** and **former** days.

When you were turned within your **mother’s womb**,

had it not been for that turning, you would not have attained certainty in **My alteration**.

Indeed, you are **One**, and I have created none **comparable, equal, similar, or akin** to you.

Thus do I create **whatever I will**, for **I am the All-Powerful, the All-Knowing**.

Then, in the **Fourth**: I have created the **essence of all things** within the **form of the human being**,

and I have made every **entity with a form** a **servant** before **Him whom We shall manifest**.

Say: *I have greater authority over you than you have over yourselves!*

O My servants, turn your gaze toward your **Master**!

Then, in the **Fifth**: All **circles** are **ascending signs** unto Me.

Here is the translation according to your instructions:

**Page 15**

Indeed, all worship Me alone.

Say: *Turn towards Him whom We shall manifest!*

This is **your Beloved**—by **night and day**, you seek none but Him.

Then, the **Sixth**: *I am not questioned concerning what I do, but all shall be questioned regarding their recognition of My oneness and Him whom We shall manifest.*

I have made **Him whom We shall manifest** the Manifestation of that decree.

Say: *If you question Him concerning what He does, then how can you claim to believe in Me?*

Indeed, He shall **question you concerning all things**, and you shall respond only **with the truth**.

Then, the **Seventh**: *All begin through Me, by you.*

And all return unto Me, through you.

Then, the **Eighth**: *Through Your signs and whatever has been revealed from You, they are created and provided for, then caused to die and brought to life.*

Then, the **Ninth**: *Whoever aspires to possess dominion over the Bayán does so by My overpowering might.*

Say: *O God, make me among the most overpowering of the overpowering!*

Write My **name** and your **deeds**, and I shall **reward you in My return** with the **best of what is granted among the worlds**.

Prepare for the **Day of Manifestation** a preparation that does not grieve **the truth**—We have commanded all believers to act accordingly.

Then, the **Tenth**: *Do not acquire knowledge except what has been revealed in the Bayán or what is derived from it through the knowledge of the letters and their branches upon the operation of the Bayán.*

Say: *O My servants, conduct yourselves with proper discipline—do not invent!*

Then, refine yourselves, then compose yourselves.

Then, the **First after Ten**: *Do not transgress the bounds of the Bayán, lest you grieve.*

And do not grieve for **any soul**, for **it is the greatest limit**—

**Page 16**

Perhaps you shall not grieve over **Him whom We shall manifest**.

Whoever transgresses shall **not be judged by guidance**,

for none brings **guidance** except the one who manifests **guidance**.

Say: *O possessors of guidance, be guided by My guidance!*

Then, the **Second after Ten**: *O My servants, cleanse the lands of the earth and all that is within them.*

In the **First One**, let all affairs be **conducted accordingly**.

Then, the **Third after Ten**: *O My servants, raise the stations of the One, to the extent that you are capable!*

Then, the **Fourth after Ten**: *O My servants, if you seek refuge in those lands, you shall be safe among the people, and they shall not have power over you.*

Thus, on the **Day of Resurrection**, you shall seek refuge in **him who is raised from his resting place**.

However, on **that day**, you shall not seek refuge as you once did in **former days**.

Upon you shall descend what shall cause the **heavens, the earth, and all that is between them to be rent asunder** when you hear it.

So why do you not comprehend?

Then, the **Fifth after Ten**: *Do not prevent anyone from seeking refuge in God.*

Then, in the **Letters of the Living**, upon the **Manifestation in the latter days**, and even before, in the **former days**, you shall make your judgments.

If one seeks refuge in **someone**, and that person is killed in the **path of God**, it is better in the sight of God than for him to be turned away.

Say: *O My servants, grant refuge!*

Then, the **Sixth after Ten**: *O My servants, ascend to My House!*

This is the **House of Him whom God shall make manifest**.

Here is the translation according to your instructions:

**Page 17**

This is **My House**—do not purchase what surrounds it, except to the extent that you are able to elevate it.

Then, the **Seventh after Ten**: *What surrounds the House and the Mosque belongs to God—do not sell it!*

Let each of you maintain what is within the limits of your dominion, according to your ability, in order to establish your reports.

Those who engage in trade do so as they desire and write as they please.

The **Sacred Mosque** is **where Him whom God shall make manifest is born**.

It is the very place where He was **brought forth**.

Say: *The station of **Aḥmad** is My remembrance—enter therein!*

There you shall pray.

Do not ascend toward My House or its stations unless you possess what is required along the way, so that you do not grieve.

Whoever has the ability to enter upon Me or upon the House shall not be excused.

This is that you may **enter upon Him whom We shall manifest**,

then within **the House of God, your Lord**, you shall humble yourselves before Him and prostrate.

Then, the **Eighth after Ten**: If people desire to perform the **pilgrimage to My House**,

let them offer the **Manifestations of the One** four **mithqáls** of gold upon their inner purity,

if they walk upon the path of **ultimate love for you**.

We have pardoned those who are unable,

as well as those who possess wealth, those who serve, those who follow, or those who are tested—perhaps they may be grateful.

This is that you may **know the Lord of the House**,

and then you shall **enter through the Gate of the House**.

This is **He who teaches you the inner knowledge of the outward and the outward knowledge of the inward**.

This is **Myself in My final appearance**.

O My servants—

**Page 18**

O My servants, **know Me**!

This is that you may **ascend toward Him whom We shall manifest**—if it is indeed **Him**.

Then, you shall ascend to **His House**.

So why do you not ascend to **His very Self**?

At that time, all will ascend toward **My House** as they did before,

yet they remain veiled from the One who has made the **House** truly a **House**.

Then, the **Ninth after Ten**: *Were it not that it would grieve the women, I would not forbid them from ascending, for it would burden them upon the path.*

Only those who dwell in the land of the **House**—if they so wish—may enter **the House by night**.

Then, upon their private chambers, in the presence of the **Manifestations of the One**, they shall sit and remember **their Lord, who created them**.

Afterward, they shall return to their dwellings.

Let them **guard the love of their husbands, their children, and their steeds**—

do not draw near to what will cause you grief.

You were created **for yourselves**, and then **for your children**.

Do not **prefer distant journeys**—

recite and give thanks to God for what you have been **exempted from**.

God is the **All-Knowing, the All-Wise**.

O **Manifestations of the One** in the **A** and the **B**,

do not question the **Self**, for it **knows its own decree**.

Then, before **the One who made you guardians of the House**, prostrate!

Indeed, I shall **enter the House**, while **you do not recognize Me**.

So be **gracious** toward all who **enter My House**—perhaps you shall **perceive Me**.

## Vahid 5

**The Fifth One**

Here is the translation according to your instructions:

**Page 19**

**In the Name of God, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Holy**

By God, indeed, **I am God—there is no god but Me, the Most Ancient!**

I have revealed in the **First Gate of the Fifth Fifth**:

Raise the **mosque** upon the station where **He was born**, according to your capacity.

Then, the **Second**: By My permission, you shall elevate the **mosques of the Living**,

and set within them as many **lamps** as you desire, that you may count them.

Then, the **Third**: We have made the **year** **nineteen months**,

so that you may walk upon the **path of the One**.

Then, the **Fourth**: You shall name yourselves by **My Names**.

I have made you **Bahá’í**!

Say: *O My creation, turn toward Me alone!*

And let your names include **Muḥammad**, **‘Alí**, and **Fáṭimah**,

then **the two Ḥasans**, then **Mahdí and Hádí**.

We have assigned a **name** to each **letter** of your name.

Say: *All belong to Me, and I belong to God, my Lord. There is no god but God.*

This is the **sovereignty over all the worlds**.

This is the **Beloved of the worlds**.

This is the **King of the worlds**.

This is the **Desired One of the worlds**.

This is the **Worshipped One of the worlds**.

This is the **Sought-after One of the worlds**.

This is **your God and your King**.

Then, **your Lord and your Sovereign**.

Then, **your Ruler and your Master**.

Then, the **Described One of the worlds**.

Then, the **Fifth**: You shall take from those who have **not entered the Bayán** only that which is attributed to them.

If they believe, you shall return it to them, except in a land where you are **unable**.

Then, the **Sixth**: If a **land is opened in the Bayán**,

it shall be taken only from those for whom **there is no equivalent**, in accordance with the decree.

Let the **self** be safeguarded—

if it does not change among those who trade, let them **not trade apart from Me**, nor diminish from **My Splendor**.

He shall take **his due** from every thousand that **buy and sell**, one hundred,

as a bounty from Us for **Him whom We shall manifest in truth**.

Indeed, We have been accounting.

Then, the **letter "H"** shall be taken,

and preserved by the **First Letters** among those **entrusted**.

Then, the **letter "W"** shall be taken for the **witnesses**.

Then, it shall be **assigned for marriage** in the Bayán,

to those who are **unable**.

Then, **dominion** shall be exercised as it wills.

Each rightful person shall be given their **due** from among its **troops**.

If there is an **excess**, it shall be used for the **elevated stations**,

or distributed among **all the believers**—

this is **closer in the Book of God**.

Even if a **soul** resides in a land, it shall receive something from it, as a **bounty from God**.

Indeed, He is the **Most Generous, the Most Munificent**.

**Page 20**

Then, the **Seventh**: *Whatever enters the religion, and whatever is owned by the believers from among those outside it, shall be purified at the time of possession.*

This is a **favor**, as long as **you trade among your brothers and the worlds**.

Say: *If something is attributed to one who believes in the Bayán, it shall be purified immediately.*

O My servants, then be **grateful**!

Purchase whatever you **love** from every **land**,

that you may **possess something subtle and refined**.

Then, the **Eighth**: *Recite the Bayán, and from its ocean, draw forth its pearls.*

Do not diminish from its **nineteen signs**.

And if you do not—

Here is the translation according to your instructions:

**Page 21**

You shall learn to say:

*"God, God is my Lord! I do not associate anything with God, my Lord!"*

If, on the **Day of My Return**, you are not harmed by anyone,

and if, in your words, you are of the truthful—

yet this will not benefit you if you **hear of My Manifestation** and then remain **among those who sit idle**.

Then, the **Ninth**: Remember **Me** through the **letters of all things**,

by whatever name **you remember Me**,

even if it is merely what arises in your heart among the names of those who turn toward Me.

Then, the **Tenth**: I have **bestowed upon you** the **temples and the circles**,

and I have granted you a bounty through them.

Say: *All of the Bayán is within them!*

Write upon them in whatever manner you are able to read.

Then, the **First after Ten**:

You shall place the **newborn** upon the ground **five times**, standing upright.

After each time, say **nineteen times**:

*"Verily, we all believe in God!"*

*"Verily, we all have certainty in God!"*

*"Verily, we all originate from God!"*

*"Verily, we all shall return to God!"*

*"Verily, we all are content with God!"*

Then, for the **deceased**, place them down **six times**, and say **nineteen times**:

*"Verily, we all are servants of God!"*

After magnifying God in the first instance, say:

*"Verily, we all prostrate before God!"*

*"Verily, we all stand in devotion to God!"*

*"Verily, we all act for God!"*

*"Verily, we all are sincere before God!"*

*"Verily, we all act for God!"*

*"Verily, we all are sincere before God!"*

*"Verily, we all praise God!"*

You shall **bury the deceased** in **crystal** or **polished stone**,

that you may dwell in peace.

You shall place a **seal ring** on his **right hand**, inscribed with a verse—

**Page 22**

—a **verse that has been decreed**, that you may find solace.

Say: *Man writes for God whatever is in the heavens and the earth and all that is between them. God is the All-Knowing, the Almighty, the Inaccessible.*

Say: *Man commands by what has been revealed in the Mighty Book. To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them. God is the All-Knowing, the Almighty, the Inaccessible.*

Then, the **Second after Ten**:

You shall **bury the deceased** with **a portion of the soil** from **the First and the Last**.

Then, the **Third after Ten**:

You shall **write a testament** addressed to **Him whom We shall manifest**.

What you **write**, you **write unto God**, if you are truly certain in Him.

Then, the **Fourth after Ten**:

The **Name of God purifies you** when you recite:

*"God is the Most Pure!"* **sixty-six times**.

Then, the **Point**, and what radiates from it—

the **verses of God and His words**—if you are truly certain in them.

Then, all who **enter the Faith**,

then whatever **transforms in its essence**,

then **fire, air, water, and earth**,

then the **sun when it dries**—

O My servants, then be **grateful**!

Then, the **Fifth after Ten**:

**The Water of Life is pure**—by it, you are created.

Refine your bodies **with it**, that you may **experience delight**.

Then, the **Sixth after Ten**:

Whatever has **no equivalent** belongs to **God**.

This is for **Him whom God shall manifest**,

for all things, according to the **number of the One**.

O My servants, you shall **reach Him**!

And when the **sun sets**, take control over yourselves.

Then, on the **Day of My Manifestation**, you shall return to Me.

Then, the **Seventh after Ten**:

Every day, you shall say **nine times**—

Here is the translation according to your instructions:

**Page 23**

And say **ninety-nine times**:

*"God is the Most Great!"*

Then, fear **Me alone**!

Then, the **Eighth after Ten**:

Permit **all My servants** to engage in **buying and selling**,

provided that **they act with mutual satisfaction**.

Then, those who engage in trade—**they do not seek delay**,

but when the **time comes**, they do not withhold.

Then, the **Ninth after Ten**:

The weight of a **mithqál** is **nineteen chickpeas** of **gold and silver**.

The **first radiance of kingship** is set at **ten thousand dínárs**,

the **second** at **one thousand dínárs**.

If these amounts are **reduced**, let them not fall below the **chickpea** measure.

Without this, you shall **not engage** in transactions within your dominion.

Whoever reduces the **measure** shall have **nothing**,

nor shall anyone **who does not possess** at least **five hundred forty mithqáls**

and has **not completed a year**—

this is a bounty from Us, that you may be **grateful**.

Then, after this, if you find a **sovereign** who does not exceed the limits of the **Bayán**,

then you shall convey unto him:

From every **mithqál of gold**, **five hundred dínárs**.

From every **mithqál of silver**, **fifty dínárs**.

Perhaps, on the **Day of My Manifestation**, this will **aid the Faith of His Lord**,

so that **no one will be forced** to take even the **smallest measure unjustly**.

If so, then your **tax shall be doubled**, if you are among the reverent.

Do not demand **the people’s records**, lest you grieve over any soul—

for they do not realize that **they do not give** because they think themselves **self-sufficient**.

Yet I have commanded that **they be encompassed**,

from the moment of their **birth until their death**,

in **all that they possess**, in **the radiance of His splendor**,

so that they may be **among the grateful**.

**Page 24**

What I have **permitted** is only the right of **Him whom God shall manifest**.

I have permitted it for **His servants**,

perhaps they will be **ashamed before Him**,

yet over Him, they have **no judgment** and **shall not grieve**.

Otherwise, it belongs to **Me and My Names**,

within which **none shall be seen but Me alone**.

O My creation, upon the **First Letters**, you shall pray.

## Vahid 6

**The Sixth One**

**In the Name of God, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Holy**

Indeed, **I am God—there is no god but Me, the Most Gracious, the Most Gracious!**

I have revealed the **Bayán** and made it a **proof from Us over all the worlds**.

Within it is **that which has no equal**—these are the **signs of God**.

Say: *All are powerless before them!*

Within it is **that which has no equivalent**—this is **what you are called to**.

Within it is **that which has no resemblance**—this is **what We have explained**.

This is **the "A" between the two "B"s**—

you shall comprehend it **at the gate**.

Within it is **that which has no companion**—

this is the **essence of knowledge and wisdom**,

and you shall answer **through it**.

Within it is **that which has no likeness**—

this is what is **uttered by the Persians**,

and within the **One**, you shall **bring it into order**.

Do not **write the hidden** except that you align it **with the signs**,

according to the **number of al-Mustagháṯ**—

do not **exceed it**!

And from the **beginning of the count**, it has been **permitted for you**—

O My servants!

Here is the translation according to your instructions:

**Page 25**

You shall dwell in **security**,

and I have permitted that **every soul may have a thousand houses**,

whatever they **desire**, that they may **delight** in it.

When they recite, they shall be among those **who are protected**.

Say: *The House consists of **thirty letters**—if you express them clearly, you shall calculate by the number of **M**.*

Then, you shall **write it in the most beautiful script and preserve it**.

This is the **First One**—you dwell in **God’s presence**.

Then, the **Second**:

In every land, you shall **build a free house**,

and you shall **beautify every land** and all that is within it,

to the **best of your ability**,

so that My **eye may not bear witness to what is displeasing**.

O My servants, then **fear Me**!

This is **closer than all things**, if you truly understand.

Then, the **Third**:

None shall **dwell in the land of the five** except **My reverent servants**.

Then, the **Fourth**:

You shall **submit to God**, saying:

*"God is the Greatest!"*

Then, you shall respond:

*"God is the Most Supreme!"*

Then, say:

*"God is the Most Glorious!"*

And whoever responds:

*"God is the Most Beautiful!"*

Then, **fear Me alone**!

Then, the **Fifth**:

Water is **pure, purified, and purifying**—

in the **cup**, it is the **ocean’s decree**.

You shall bear witness to this.

Then, the **Sixth**:

Erase everything you have **written**,

and replace it with **the Bayán**,

and whatever **you establish under its shade**.

Then, the **Seventh**:

You shall **draw the "B" closer to the "A"**,

as We have **revealed in the Book**.

Then, **fear Me alone**!

Say:

*"In the cities, ninety-five mithqáls of gold."*

And in the **villages**, the **same amount in silver**,

until it reaches **nineteen mithqáls**,

by what corresponds to the **number of the One**.

**Page 26**

If the **One** is found in **mutual satisfaction**,

then you shall be **cut off from attachment**,

and by **elevation**, you shall be **raised**.

Each **one shall be granted a dowry**,

and all shall say:

*"Verily, we are all content with God!"*

God has made all **the treasures of the earth** a **dowry**

for **her who is created for Him whom God shall manifest**.

This is the **bounty of God upon him**,

that he may be **among the grateful**.

Then, the **Eighth**:

Do not seek proof except through the **signs**,

for whoever **does not rely upon them, has no knowledge**.

Do not mention **any miracle apart from them**,

that you may believe **at the very moment of My Manifestation**.

Recite this, and make it the **extent of your vision**,

so that on the **Day of My Manifestation**, you shall **not be veiled**.

Then, the **Ninth**:

You shall wear **silken garments** on the **night of life**.

If you are able to do otherwise, then **do not wear them**.

Your **resources**, through which you **live in secret**,

shall be made from **gold and silver**.

And if you do not find them available,

then **do not grieve**,

for I am **your Lord**!

I shall **bring you provision in your Hereafter**,

if you truly believe **in Me and My signs**.

Then, the **Tenth**:

You shall wear **red agate** in your hands,

and you shall engrave upon it:

*"Bear witness, through this, that He whom We shall manifest is the Truth, beyond doubt!"*

All are created **through Him and for Him**.

Say:

*"God is the Truth, and all besides God is creation. All worship Him alone!"*

Then, the **First after Ten**:

Say:

*"O Muḥammad, my teacher, do not strike me before I have reached five years of age, not even for a fleeting moment, for my heart is exceedingly tender—exceedingly tender!"*

Here is the translation according to your instructions:

**Page 27**

After that, **discipline me**, but do not take me **beyond the limit of oddness**.

If you wish to strike, do not exceed **five times**,

and do not strike **the flesh** except by placing a **barrier** between them.

If you **exceed this**, then your **spouse** shall be forbidden to you for **nineteen days**.

If you **forget**, and if you **have no spouse**,

then you shall give **nineteen mithqáls of gold** for what you have struck,

if you wish to be **among the believers**.

Strike only **lightly, lightly**.

Let the **children rest upon a bed, a throne, or a chair**,

for this shall **not be counted against their lifespan**.

Allow them to enjoy what **brings them joy**.

You shall **learn the Nasta‘līq script**,

for this is **beloved by God**,

and He has made it the **Gate of His Self for all scripts**,

so that you may write in a way that **removes the intoxication from your hearts**.

It shall make you **like water** for **Him whom We shall manifest**.

When **your eyes gaze upon Him**,

He shall **draw you in**, just as We have been **writing**.

I have **connected you with an heir**,

so that the **Throne of your Lord does not grieve** in his youth,

and all who belong to Him **shall not grieve**.

Say: *If you bear witness, I shall withhold from you what I have granted you of My dominion!*

O My servants, then **fear Me**!

Then, the **Second after Ten**:

Do not **draw near** to **Ṭ and Q**,

but if you are forced, be patient for a **year**,

so that you may **draw near to the One with love**.

Otherwise, permission is granted for them,

but if they wish to return, let them **seek permission**

by repeating **nineteen times** after a month has passed,

so that you do not enter the **gates of those veiled from the truth**.

**Page 28**

Then, the **Third after Ten**:

Do not make the **gates of the House of the Point** exceed **ninety-five gates**,

nor the **gates of the Houses of the Letters** exceed **five**.

O My servants, in this, you shall **find all knowledge**.

Then, the **Fourth after Ten**:

On the **Day of God**,

you shall proclaim, in the **greatest number of all things**:

*"God has borne witness that there is no god but Him, the Almighty, the Beloved!"*

You shall be **immersed in the spirit of remembrance** and **seal it with the mention of power**.

Then, on a **night among the nights of God**,

you shall count **nineteen cycles** before you,

until you reach the **number of Mustagháth**.

This is permitted for those who **are able**.

Do not grieve if you **cannot**,

for with God, upon the **Throne**, there is only **One**.

Say: *Fear Me alone and be grateful!*

Say: *This is the **Day of the Point**, the **number of the Living**, and the **months of the Living**—you shall ascend upon the **ocean of creation**!*

Then, the **Fifth after Ten**:

You shall **all rise together** when you hear the **mention of Him whom We shall manifest**.

At the **mention of His name as the Qá'im**,

you shall **observe the distinction between the Qá'im and the Qayyúm**.

Then, in the **ninth year**, you shall attain **all goodness**.

Then, the **Sixth after Ten**:

Do not **travel except for God**, if you **are able**.

Except at the **Manifestation of the Truth**,

then you must **travel to Him**,

for **you were created for this purpose**.

Even if **on foot**, you must **walk to Him**.

You are **not obliged** except to visit:

1.  

2.  The **House**,

3.  

4.  The **station of the Point**, if you are able,

5.  

6.  The **stations of the Living**,

7.  

8.  The **mosques**, if you are able.

9.  

If you seek **commerce**,

do not remain on **land** for more than **two years**,

nor at **sea** for more than **five years**.

Here is the translation according to your instructions:

**Page 29**

Whoever **exceeds the limit**,

let him give his **spouse** **two hundred and two mithqáls of gold**, if he is able—

otherwise, in silver.

Let your **spouses be uplifted with you**,

so that you may have **no sorrow** in the **Bayán**.

Whoever grants **protection** to someone **on a journey**,

even if it is for **a single step**,

or enters another’s house **without permission**,

or **seeks to expel someone from their home without right**,

or **demands someone from their home unjustly**—

his **spouse** shall be **forbidden to him for nineteen months**.

Whoever **transgresses God's decree** in this matter,

the **witnesses of the Bayán** shall take from him **ninety-five mithqáls of gold**.

Whoever **claims to offer protection** for someone,

and is aware of it and has the ability to act—

even if it is only for **part of a year**,

he is required to be present and prevent it.

If he **fails to attend** despite his ability,

his **wife shall be forbidden to him for nineteen days**,

and she shall not be permitted to him unless he gives **nineteen mithqáls of gold**, if he is able—

otherwise, in silver.

This is that **no soul should be wronged in the Bayán**.

Whoever **raises his voice unjustly** shall be **expelled from the bounds of humanity**.

O My servants, then **fear Me**!

Then, the **Seventh after Ten**:

Whatever comes from **animals**, do not despise it,

unless you **wish to refine it**.

Then, the **Eighth after Ten**:

It is **forbidden** in your Faith **to look at the writings of others**

unless **permission is given**,

or you **know** they are **pleased with it**.

Perhaps you will learn **modesty**,

and conduct yourselves with **proper discipline**.

Then, the **Ninth after Ten**:

It is **obligatory** in your Faith to respond to those who speak to you,

with words that indicate **"yes" or "no"**.

Likewise, in your **writings**,

when one **writes to another**,

**Page 30**

he is **obligated to respond in writing** immediately, if he is able—

otherwise, another may write in his place.

Whoever **rejects or loses a letter**,

when he is able to **deliver it** yet does not—

he shall **not be counted among the worshippers of God**.

## Vahid 7

**The Seventh One**

**In the Name of God, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Holy**

Indeed, **I am God—there is no god but Me, the Most Just, the Most Just!**

Say:

*"Renew the Bayán!"*

Then, **all your books** shall be **renewed**,

whenever the **count of the Name of God** has been completed for those who are able,

and the **count of the Name "R" and "B"** for those who are not able,

so that you may **perceive the affairs of the Hereafter**.

If the **second** is better, then choose it—

otherwise, the **first** is better for him.

If no script is found **like the original**,

then do **not alter it**.

If the **original is changed**,

you shall **spend it or immerse it in pure water**,

and **adorn your books**,

from the **first letter of the alphabet** to the **mention of eternity**,

so that you may be **grateful**.

This is the **First One**.

Then, in the **Second**:

You shall act **for God, your Lord**,

and whatever you do, you shall know:

If you act **with sincerity** for **Him whom We shall manifest**,

then you are **acting for God**.

Otherwise, even if you perform **every good deed**,

you are in **the fire**,

and it shall **not be counted for God**,

even if you **intend it for Him**.

Then, the **Third**:

Your **Faith**—whenever you are able,

you shall **restore it**,

and within every **One**,

a **Book of Affirmation** shall be written for **Him whom We shall manifest**,

from **one among you to another**.

Here is the translation according to your instructions:

**Page 31**

You shall **write**,

so that on the **Day of His Manifestation**,

you may **act upon what you have written**.

Then, the **Fourth**:

In every **year**,

for **one month**,

you shall **purify yourselves in the Name of God**,

so that on the **Day of the Manifestation of the Truth**,

you may **respond to Him**.

Nothing shall come from your mouths **except a single Name**,

but if you **forget** and speak otherwise, **there is no blame upon you**.

Say: *All things belong to God, and all things point to God!*

Then, the **Fifth**:

At the **Manifestation of God**,

when He **appears**,

**deeds shall cease** for all souls,

except for what has been **commanded**.

O My servants, then **fear Me**!

Even if all upon the earth were made **prophets**,

they would still be **prophets in the sight of God**.

Yet He shall appoint only **whomever He wills**,

for **God is the All-Knowing, the Wise**.

Then, the **Sixth**:

Do not **carry weapons of war** among yourselves,

and do not wear **that which frightens children**,

so that you may not **grieve at the Manifestation of Him who appears in truth**.

Then, the **Seventh**:

If you attain **Him whom We shall manifest**,

you shall ask of **the bounty of God**,

that He may **favor you** by **establishing Himself upon your hearts**.

This is not **forbidden** nor **beyond reach**.

To **drink a cup of water in His presence**

is **greater** than to **drink all the water of existence**,

and beyond that, greater than **all things**.

O My servants, then **perceive**!

Then, the **Eighth**:

In every **month**,

on **one day**,

you shall inscribe the **Name of your Lord, God the Most Great**,

in the **most beautiful script**.

If it is **written for you**, let it be written **behind you**,

so that on the **Day of the Manifestation of God**,

you may **believe in the First One**.

Then, you shall **increase in faith**.

Then, the **Ninth**:

Whoever is **raised** in that **religion of kingship**,

he shall build a **House for God**,

with **ninety-five gates**.

Then, opposite it, there shall be **ninety gates**

for **Him whom We shall manifest**.

The **clay** from His presence shall bear witness

that **dominion belongs to God**.

If it **testifies**,

it shall testify **only to what is wrought in accordance with His will**.

O My…

Here is the translation according to your instructions:

**Page 32**

O My servants, then **fear Me**!

Then, the **Tenth**:

You shall **protect your children** within a **mighty form**,

bearing within it the **Name of God**,

according to the **number of Mustagháth**,

so that on the **Day of Resurrection**,

you may be **saved through that Name**.

Then, the **First after Ten**:

You shall **sit upon the throne**,

**study**, and **deliver sermons**

on the **days of might and the days of sorrow**.

Then, **fear Me alone**!

Then, the **Second after Ten**:

If you **recognize Him whom We shall manifest**,

do not render your deeds **null**

by **associating partners with God**,

while **being unaware of it**.

Then, the **Third after Ten**:

To **possess from God's own self**

**nineteen signs** by **His decree**

is **better than all bounty**,

if you truly **understand the value of God's verses**.

God has created **nothing more precious than this**,

if you perceive **the secret of the Cause**.

Then, the **Fourth after Ten**:

It is **forbidden** in your **Faith**

to seek **repentance before any person**,

except **Him whom We shall manifest**,

or whomever He permits.

Instead, you shall **seek forgiveness**

from **God, your Lord, the Almighty**,

and then **repent to Him**.

Then, the **Fifth after Ten**:

When you stand **before the gate** of the **City of Him whom We shall manifest**,

you shall **prostrate**,

just as it has been revealed before,

so that you may **fear Me alone**,

if you **do not fear others**.

Then, the **Sixth after Ten**:

It is decreed upon the **sovereign on the Day of Manifestation**

to **write down whatever is revealed from the Point**,

and to **present it before the scholars**,

so that their **powerlessness may be exposed** to all who dwell upon the earth.

He shall not allow any to **dwell in his land** who **do not believe in Him**.

Likewise, this was **revealed in the Bayán**

before **His Manifestation**,

except—

**Page 33**

—those who **engage in trade within their dominion**.

Say: *O My servants, then **fear Me**!*

Then, the **Seventh after Ten**:

On **Friday**, when facing the **sun**,

recite these **verses**,

so that on the **Day of Resurrection**,

when you stand **before the Sun of Reality**,

you may declare:

*"Verily, all Bahá comes from God! O Rising Sun, bear witness to what God has borne witness to concerning Himself: there is no god but Him, the Almighty, the Beloved!"*

Then, the **Eighth after Ten**:

Whoever **imprisons another**

shall have his **wives forbidden to him**,

and if he draws near to them,

he shall be **fined nineteen mithqáls of gold** each month.

If the **prisoner perishes**,

the **witnesses** are obligated to **banish the oppressor**,

and his **faith shall not be accepted**.

O My servants, then **fear Me**!

Whoever **grieves another soul intentionally**,

even by **a single act**,

shall owe **a penalty of nineteen mithqáls of gold**,

if he is able—

otherwise, in **silver**.

However, if he **is granted permission**,

or if he **forgets**,

let him **seek God's forgiveness**

**nineteen times**.

Say: *O My servants, then **fear Me**!*

Then, the **Ninth after Ten**:

**All prayers are lifted from you**,

except from **one zenith to another**,

**nineteen rak‘ahs**,

one by one—

with **standing, devotion, and prostration**,

so that on the **Day of Resurrection**,

you may **stand before God**,

then **prostrate,**

then **devote yourselves,**

then **sit in humility**.

Within your hearts,

let there be **a verse of the One for your Lord**,

so that you may be **saved through it**.

Then, **fear Me alone**,

and **prostrate before God**!

## Vahid 8

**The Eighth One**

**In the Name of God, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Holy**

Indeed, **I am God—there is no god but Me, the Most Manifest, the Most Manifest!**

Look upon the **Book**,

for We have borne witness to **what We have revealed**.

Indeed, every **deed** revealed through **Him whom We shall manifest**

is **greater before God** than—

Here is the translation according to your instructions:

**Page 34**

Greater than all that you glorify.

Say: *It is like the sun, which is never joined with the planets.*

O My servants, then **fear Him alone**!

This is the **First One**.

Then, the **Second**:

If you are able, acquire **nineteen sheets** of the **highest parchment**,

and **one stone of carnelian** for your **seal ring**,

if you are able to count them.

Say: *Inheritance from the deceased belongs only to **his father, his mother, his children, his spouse, his brother, and his sister, and to the one who taught him**—after he has set aside for himself whatever may ease his soul after death.*

When you hear of the **death of a soul for God**,

you shall **attend**,

and you shall **not rise from your gatherings**.

Then, the **Third**:

On the **Day of Resurrection**,

when you hear the **decree**:

*"Everything perishes, except the **Face**—the remembrance of the Name of your Lord, the Possessor of Sovereignty and Power!"*

You shall **gather before God**,

then before the **Living One**,

then seek **forgiveness from God, your Lord, the All-Merciful**,

then **repent to God**.

If you are unable,

ask of **God’s bounty in your writings**.

If you come across the **word ‘pardon’ from God**,

it is **better than all bounties**, if you understand.

Then, the **Fourth**:

All **good** that you **gather**,

its **highest** portion belongs to **Him whom We shall manifest**,

then its **lowest** to those who **believe in Him**,

and its **middle** to those who **guide others to the Point**.

You shall gaze upon the **Letters of Truth**.

Then, the **Fifth**:

If you are able, obtain:

-   

-   **Three diamonds**,

-   

-   **Four topazes**,

-   

-   **Six emeralds**,

-   

-   **Six rubies**—

-   

so that on the **Day of Manifestation**,

you may deliver them **to the Letters of the One**,

in accordance with the decree.

**Page 35**

You shall make their **radiance as the radiance of the First One**,

so that you may have **certainty in God**.

Then, the **Sixth**:

Refine **your bodies** every **four days**,

with whatever you are able to **purify yourselves with**.

Gaze into the **mirror**,

both **night and day**,

so that you may be **grateful**.

Then, the **Seventh**:

You shall pray **in the cloak**,

and they shall pray **in their garments**.

There is **no blame upon them** if their **hair and bodies** are visible **before their spouses** while they pray.

You shall **trim the hair of your faces** for **strength and beauty**,

and **adorn yourselves** in whatever pleases you upon your **bodies**,

so that in the **Days of God**, you may **be thankful**.

Say: *The **Qiblah** is **Him whom We shall manifest**—wherever He turns, you shall turn, until He is settled.*

Before and after, you shall know.

Say: *Wherever you turn, there is the **Face of God**!*

You are gazing toward **God**.

Then, the **Eighth**:

Whoever reaches the **Day of Resurrection**,

let him **write down** from his **earnings**,

both **his good deeds and his faults**,

so that you may **understand the Resurrection of the next life**.

Then, the **Ninth**:

Whoever raises **a community**,

it is permitted for them **to gaze upon and speak with one another**,

whether **men to men, or women to women**.

O My servants, then **fear Me**!

Then, you shall **remain conscious of Him**.

Beyond this, let there be **only what is fruitful between them**.

Say: *Above twenty-eight words, you shall remain conscious—unless you are not self-sufficient.*

Then, the **Tenth**:

You shall use the **toothpick and miswák**,

after you **finish your sustenance**,

to **purify your mouths**.

Then, you shall **rest**.

You shall **wash your faces and hands** up to the **wrist**,

if you wish to **pray**.

Then, you shall **dry your faces and hands with a cloth**.

And in the **House of Purity**,

you shall **preserve whatever carries a fragrance**.

Here is the translation according to your instructions:

**Page 36**

With a **cloth**, so that you may not witness anything other than what you love.

Perform **ablution** upon the **Form of Unity** with **pure water**,

like **rose water**,

so that on the **Day of Resurrection**,

you may enter **before God, perfumed with rose water and fragrance**.

Your **scent** shall not alter your **deeds**,

and if you recite the **basmalah five times**,

it shall **suffice for your ablution** when you cannot find water,

or if its use becomes difficult for you.

Perhaps you may **be grateful**.

Say:

*"In every Manifestation, the essence of fire is transformed into light, and your deeds are laid bare before you. You gaze toward the Point of the Cause."*

You are **pardoned** for what you **witness in visions**,

yet you shall seek **understanding of your own selves**.

Know the **value of water**,

for it is the **cause of the creation of a soul that worships God**.

You dwell within the **sanctuary of might**,

preserving yourselves,

so that you may **aid the Faith of God through the fruits of your own souls**.

If you find that **water by your own choice**,

then perform **ablution**,

then **prostrate**,

and recite **nineteen times**:

*"Glory be to You, O God! There is no god but You! Glory be to You! Indeed, I am among those who glorify You!"*

If the **water changes**,

it shall **suffice**,

after you have already performed ablution.

Similarly, you shall **wash your head, your body, your hands, and your feet**,

while you **praise God in your deeds**.

As for **women**,

when they experience **menstrual blood**,

they are **not obligated to pray or fast**,

except that they may **perform ablution**

and then glorify God **ninety-five times**,

from **one zenith to another**,

saying:

**Page 37**

*"Glory be to God, the One with Radiance and Beauty!"*

If you and they are **on a journey**,

then after descending and resting,

they shall **prostrate once in place of every prayer**,

then **glorify God**,

then **sit upon the Form of Unity**,

and **glorify God eighteen times**,

then **rise again**.

All of this is so that you may **be grateful in the Religion of God**.

Then, the **First after Ten**:

You shall **wash your dead**—

if you are able—

**five times** with **purified water**,

then shroud them in **five layers** of **silk or cotton**,

after placing the **seal ring upon their hand**—

a **gift from God to the living**,

so that they may believe in **Him whom We shall manifest on the Day of Resurrection**.

In the **heat**, wash your dead **with whatever pleases you** for yourselves.

With the **hands of the reverent**, wash them.

In the **cold**, use **warm water**.

Between the two, wash them with whatever **pleases you**.

Then, anoint the **entire body of the deceased**

with **rose water or its equivalent**, if you are able.

Then, turn them with the **utmost tranquility and love**.

You shall **visit your dead** every **nineteen days**,

or even more frequently, if you find it easy.

If possible, for **nineteen days and nights**,

do not leave their proximity,

so that the **verses of God may be recited**,

and that **you may keep a lamp burning near them**.

Then, the **Second after Ten**:

*"I have borne witness—upon the stroke of every affliction—that all sorrow shall pass. Do not grieve!"*

For **in that moment, all things will bow before you**,

and those who have earned **good or evil**,

if they truly understood,

would return,

then seek **forgiveness**.

Say:

*"Whoever dwells upon that land shall be gathered to all that is within it."*

Here is the translation according according to your instructions:

**Page 38**

For a year and years, in a **league’s distance**,

if he has **completed twenty-nine years of his life**,

it is required that he **attend the place of the stroke** once every year,

and remain there for **nineteen days**, to purify himself.

At the **site of the stroke**,

one **unit of prayer** shall be performed.

Whoever **is unable**,

let him devote himself to God, his Lord, in his **own home for nineteen days**.

Whoever **cannot even do this**,

he is excused **by My bounty**.

Yet **the ruler of the earth** shall decree what is necessary to restore this practice.

O servants of God, then **fear Him**!

Then, the **Third after Ten**:

You shall **magnify the Point**,

from its **beginning to its end**,

**ninety-five times** in your **prayers**.

You shall all perform **one prayer**,

yet you shall **direct yourselves individually**.

Then, the **Fourth after Ten**:

If you **learn the Bayán**,

then recite from its **verses** whatever you love,

**by night and by day**.

Otherwise, you shall **mention God seven hundred times**,

if you are **in the Spirit**,

or whatever allows you to **revive yourselves**.

Then, the **Fifth after Ten**:

It is **obligatory** for every soul

to **preserve a soul from its own self**—

you shall **bind yourselves to God** in marriage,

after **eleven years have passed**,

if you have the **capacity**.

Whoever **has the ability** and does **not marry**,

his **deeds are nullified**.

If **one partner denies the other** the right to have children,

they shall wait until the decree **becomes manifest**,

but no union is **lawful** unless it is in **the Bayán**.

If **one enters into marriage improperly**,

then **the other partner** shall be **forbidden to them**,

except if the matter is **rectified** by **Him whom We shall manifest in truth**,

or if the ruling has already been **established in justice**.

Before that, they shall **bind themselves in marriage**,

so that **by this decree of God, they may be elevated**.

**Page 39**

Then, the **Sixth after Ten**:

This is **God’s justice**—

for **every one hundred mithqáls of gold**,

twenty **shall belong to God**,

if **a full year passes** and the wealth **remains undiminished**.

You shall **deliver it** to **Him whom We shall manifest**,

so that He may **give one mithqál to each of the Letters of the One**,

except for **the First One**,

who shall receive **two mithqáls**.

If this is done **before His Manifestation**,

it shall be given **to those already present**.

If it is done **after their passing**,

it shall return to **their descendants**, if they exist—

otherwise, it shall be given **as God wills**.

Whoever possesses **more than his sustenance**,

his **entire wealth shall be assessed upon his death**,

and he shall **command its division in a just manner for every year that follows**,

except at the **time of the Manifestation**,

when no **delay shall be permitted**.

Then, the **Seventh after Ten**:

If one’s **gold and silver** reach the **number of the Letters** and the **two Há’s**,

one-**sixth** shall be set aside **for God**.

Those who own **only the number designated for God** are excused.

This shall be given **to the poor from their Lord**,

to those **in distress**,

to those who **borrow**,

to those who **stand as guarantors**,

to those **who are prevented from earning**,

or to those who **are in need while traveling**.

They shall provide **for one another** with **benevolence**.

Say:

*"The closest are their descendants, and what is required for them shall be given."*

Then, the **nearest relatives**.

O you who possess **wealth**,

you are **stewards from God**—

examine what is **God’s dominion**,

and enrich the **destitute from their Lord**.

Begging in the **marketplaces** is **forbidden**.

Here is the translation according to your instructions:

**Page 40**

Whoever **begs**, the **gift is forbidden to him**.

It is **incumbent upon all** to earn a living **through work**.

Whoever is **unable**,

O **Manifestations of Wealth**,

it is upon **you** to **convey sustenance to them**.

It is **obligatory** upon you **to gain knowledge** of what is in **your Faith**,

so that **no soul** is left **in need**.

O My servants, then **fear Me**!

From this, there is a **portion for God** from **both**,

which is to be **completed each year**.

Beyond that, if it **equals the due measure**,

it shall be given to the **Point**,

at its **beginning and its end**.

Between these, you shall give **nineteen portions**

from those who are **foremost in obedience**,

if they are **commanded**.

Each one shall give according to the **number of "H"**,

to the **extent of their ability**,

to their **nearest kin**,

so that they may provide for **themselves and their own**,

if they are **certain in faith**.

Then, the **Eighth after Ten**:

In **every year**,

you shall fast for **the month of Loftiness** for **God**.

Before a **man or woman** reaches **eleven years**

from the time their **seed is formed**,

if they **desire**,

they shall fast **until noon**.

After **forty-two years**, they are **excused**.

Between **sunrise and sunset**, you shall fast,

so that on the **Day of Manifestation**,

you do not enter the **gates of fire**.

If you are **able**,

before **dawn** and after **sunset**,

you may **host others in hospitality**.

Through it, you shall **believe in Him whom We shall manifest**,

but you shall not **judge Him**,

nor shall you **eat, drink, or marry** while fasting.

Instead, you shall **delight in the verses of God**.

Let not your **mouths change**

when you **recite**.

Then, the **Ninth after Ten**:

Whenever you **hear the mention of the Point**,

**Page 41**

you shall **send blessings upon Him**,

and upon the **Letters of the Living**,

so that on the **Day of Manifestation**,

you may be **guided by them**.

If the mention is **repeated**,

**one time shall suffice for you**.

On **Friday night**,

and during the **day of Friday**,

you shall say:

*"Glory be to You, O God! Send blessings upon the Essence of the Seven Letters, then upon the Letters of Truth, in Might and Majesty!"*

This is so that on the **Day of Resurrection**,

you may **attain certainty** in what you have declared.

On that **Day**,

you shall **not merely send blessings upon Muhammad**,

nor upon the **Letters of the Living**,

while remaining **veiled from their later appearances**.

Do not send blessings upon them **yet grieve them**,

seeking their **pleasure without sincerity**.

You do not feel **shame**,

but instead, **earn what you earn**.

Whoever **sends blessings upon Him whom We shall manifest**,

**God shall send blessings upon him a thousand times**.

Likewise, if you **send blessings upon the Letters of the Living**,

it shall be as such.

## Vahid 9

**The Ninth One**

**In the Name of God, the Most Inaccessible, the Most Holy**

Indeed, **I am God—there is no god but Me, the Most Sovereign, the Most Sovereign!**

To **Me belongs** the **dominion of the heavens and the earth**,

and whatever is **between them**.

Whatever belongs to **Me**,

it shall **return to you**,

in your **beginning and your end**.

Say:

*"Every land belongs in honor to Him whom We shall manifest."*

On the **Day of His Manifestation**,

you shall **return to Him**,

even if it is **the house of your own selves**.

If you **are patient**,

We shall **make you into a fire**.

O My servants, then **fear Me**!

Here is the translation according to your instructions:

**Page 42**

The **houses of kings** belong to **Him**,

and if anyone **prays within them**,

he shall **give alms to the poor**—a **mithqál of silver**.

If you are among the **witnesses of the Bayán**,

when the **sun sets**,

you shall **permit** one to **dwell therein**,

if they are **granted permission at that time or on that day**.

Say:

\*"In the gatherings of might, you shall leave space for **nineteen souls**,

so that on the **Day of Manifestation**,

you do not **surpass them** in precedence.\*"

If the **space is abundant**, then do so—

otherwise, **one shall suffice for you**,

so that on the **Day of Manifestation**,

you may **be saved by this act**.

Unlike that **Day**,

when you shall **rise at My mention**,

yet still, you **pass judgment over Me**,

and you **show no shame**.

This is the **First One**.

Then, the **Second**:

O **physicians**,

**fear God**!

You shall **heal** through the **bounties and favors**

that were **created for God**.

O **the sick**,

you shall **visit one another**.

Whoever possesses a **handwriting**,

but does **not have an equivalent**,

let him **write a thousand houses**,

and **bequeath them**,

for **We are ever observing him**.

Then, the **Third**:

For **every kingdom**,

there shall be a **house dedicated to God**,

and its **value** shall be **written for Himself**.

It shall bear **an inscription** that declares:

\*"If the **sign of his Lord appears**,

he shall surely support Him,

with whatever means he possesses,

so that God may bestow **all goodness upon him**."\*

Say:

\*"You were created for this purpose,

and inevitably, you shall die.

So **preserve your mention until the Day of Resurrection**,

among all the worlds."\*

Then, the **Fourth**:

When you **refresh your spirits**,

you shall **delight in the remembrance of God**.

Yet the **greatest delight before God**

is when you **rejoice in what proceeds from Him whom We shall manifest**.

If you truly **find joy in Him**,

then your **hearts are exalted**.

Here is the translation according to your instructions:

**Page 43**

His **verses**,

before **His Manifestation**,

are upon **My tongue**.

Say:

*"O all things, then fear Him within it!"*

Then, the **Fifth**:

It is **decreed** upon every soul

to **serve the Point for nineteen days**

during **Its Manifestation**.

This is **lifted from you** if **pardon is granted**.

Say:

\*"This is the best of deeds,

if you are able to **perceive it**!"\*

Then, the **Sixth**:

You shall **not surpass** those communities

in which the **Point appears**,

if they are **believers**.

Say:

\*"They are better than all who dwell upon the earth.

If God knew of any greater than them in **faith**,

He would have **manifested His Cause among them**!"\*

You shall turn toward \*\*His father, His mother,

those who were with Him,

and those of His closest kin who believed in Him\*\*,

and you shall **submit yourselves to God**.

If you **show kindness** to every soul,

perhaps you may **perceive this reality**.

This is **before His Manifestation**.

Afterward, you shall **attain insight** and **understanding**.

O **Bahá'u'lláh**,

and O **your nearest kindred**,

you shall **mention God**

and **glorify all things**

at **all times—before time, during time, and after time**.

Then, the **Seventh**:

You shall **beware** of those

who are **not of Me**,

and you shall **not buy or sell**

what is **detested by God**,

for it is **forbidden to you**.

You shall **not use it**,

and in this **Faith**,

you shall **turn away from all that is hateful**,

to whatever extent you **are able**.

Then, the **Eighth**:

You shall possess **medicine**,

but as for **intoxicants and what is above them**,

you shall **not own them, sell them, buy them, nor use them**,

except for that which you **desire to manufacture**.

Then, the **Ninth**:

You shall **not pray in congregation**,

but you shall **attend the mosques**.

# Switch to O1 mini

Concerning the mosques, while you are seated upon the chair, you make mention and offer counsel in that which God loves—except during the prayer for the deceased. For at the time of gathering you pray, yet you set out as individuals. And you must make the place of My chambers within your house to be your mosque; and if you attend the mosques, it is better for you, so that perhaps on the day of God’s appearance in God’s Cause you may hasten.

**Then the Tenth**\
If you are able, acquire all the traces of the Point. And if it is in print, then provision descends upon whoever owns it, like rain. Say: “O My servants, this is the finest of trades, if indeed you believe in Him Whom We will make manifest.”

You yourselves must be purified apart from the Letters of the Most High, so that perhaps you will not enter into their realities. And you must take care not to become among them. Whoever can refrain from mentioning anything but good, that is better for him. Yet you observe what God has sent down, and indeed what has been sent down therein remains so until then. Then the Alif and the Bā are of one essence; and if He wills thereafter, in accordance with the number equaling all things—if God wills—you shall bear witness.

## Vahid 9

**Then the First after the Tenth**\
Do not sell or buy the four elements.

**Then the Second after the Tenth**\
The hair of animals, and whatever has no spirit breathed into it, does not invalidate your prayer. You give thanks in the religion of God.

**Then the Third after the Tenth**\
Never tear any book at all.

**Then the Fourth after the Tenth**\
Once nineteen years have passed, if you are able, renew all your means and possessions.

**Then the Fifth after the Tenth**\
Write down the mention of the Bayán upon all your crafts, so that perhaps, in the appearance of truth, you would be wary in your religion, and would not mention anything without right before the First Tree.

**Then the Sixth after the Tenth**\
Never strike anyone at all.

**Then the Seventh after the Tenth**\
Over the course of nineteen days, host nineteen souls, even if you provide them only with a single measure of water; and if you cannot manage that, attain to the number of one.

**Then the Eighth after the Tenth**\
Do not tear your garments, nor strike your bodies when someone among you or anyone else dies—never, ever.

**Then the Ninth after the Tenth**\
When you deem permissible the fish of the sea and the river, say: “In the name of God, the All-Preserving, the Self-Subsisting.” Then you may eat all that bears scales.

## Vahid 10

**The Single Tenth**\
In the name of God, the Most Restrained, the Most Holy. Indeed, I am God—there is no God but Me—the Most Perfect, the Most Perfect. It has been sent down in the Single Tenth that I bear witness there is no God but Me, the All-Preserving, the Self-Subsisting.

**Say, the First**\
Do not be cautious about the dog or others; and if its moist hair touches you, there is nothing but that you may wish to cleanse yourselves.

**Say, the Second**\
Truly God has permitted those who believe in the Bayán, from among the letters and letterings, to look upon them; and they, in turn, to look upon those believers, whenever they so desire.

**Then the Third**\
That which you possess from the dominion of God, you shall inherit. Therefore, apportion among yourselves what We have allotted to you, so that perhaps you may, through the enumerations thereof, enter into your own selves on the Day of God’s appearance and thereby believe in Him Whom God will make manifest, and be certain through His signs. Say: Indeed, your descendants inherit from the Book of Ṭāʾ; among them, divide with justice. Say: Whatever God has prescribed for them is by the measure of “maqt,” so that they might be thankful. Say: That which God has ordained for your spouses from the Book of Ḥāʾ is by the measure of ṭāʾ and fāʾ; among them, divide with fairness. Say: That which God has decreed in the Book from the Book of Zāʾ for your father is by the measure of ṭāʾ and kāf; judge therein by what God has appointed for you. Say: That which your mothers inherit from the Book of Wāw is by the measure of the exalted in the Book; decree it as God has determined. And that which God has laid down for your brothers is by the measure of shīn from the Book of Hāʾ; fulfill that for them as God has prescribed. And that which God has prescribed for your sisters is by the measure of rāʾ and mīm from the Book of dāl; deal justly with them in accordance with what God has ordained. And that which God has decreed for those who teach you the knowledge of the Bayān is drawn from the Book of jīm by the measure of qāf and fāʾ; you must distribute it among them with justice.

Say: God has apportioned your inheritance according to four degrees after one-third, in keeping with what is determined in the letters. Such degrees, before the four—one-third thereof—remain from the treasury of knowledge in the Book of God, unchanging and unalterable; you behold it within your own forms. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, by the measure of “hāʾ,” you will believe in Him Whom God will make manifest and be certain.

**Say: The Fourth**\
The essence of the religion, in your beginning and in your return, is that you believe in God—there is no God but He—then in Him Whom God will make manifest on the Day of Resurrection in your return; then in that which God sends down upon Him from the Book; and then in him whom God made manifest under the name ‘Alí before Muḥammad, according to what was revealed in the Bayān, of which all are powerless to grasp. Should you, at your return, attain unto Him Whom God will make manifest, then indeed you reach your beginning.

**Say: The Fifth**\
All that may be called a “thing” has been immersed in the ocean of permissibility and purity for its own self by its own self, except for those who do not believe in the Bayān, and you are not forbidden from that in the Book. For that is what you have been enjoined; it does not change from its own state, and you shall be questioned concerning that which your Lord, your God, has commanded you. Therefore, avoid all that you yourselves find repugnant.

**Say: The Sixth**\
God has forbidden you in the Bayān to cause harm, even if it be merely a hand striking a shoulder. “O servants of God, fear Him!” And indeed, when you wish to contend with the utmost modesty, record your proofs, and with the highest courtesy, speak. For you shall meet your Lord on the Day of Resurrection by meeting Him Whom God will make manifest, and the one who is the Gate for all the worlds, so that perhaps you may not meet your Lord and perform a deed that grieves your Lord by causing sadness to Him Whom God will make manifest, while you remain unaware and fail to remember.

**Indeed, the Seventh**\
Each of you must convey on behalf of yourselves to Him Whom God will make manifest a crystal container of a most rare and invulnerable perfume from the Point of the Bayán. Then bow down before God with your own hands, not by the hands of others—unless you are entirely unable.

**Indeed, the Eighth**\
Do not prostrate yourselves except upon crystal containing specks of the first and the last dust, as a mention from God in the Book, so that you do not bear witness to anything displeasing.

**Indeed, the Ninth**\
Every soul must acquire a lofty, impregnable crystal in the measure of the One, according to what is possible. If someone is able but does not own it, it is prescribed for him to give nineteen mithqáls of gold as a specified limit in the Book of God, so that you may act with awareness.

**Indeed, the Tenth**\
The letters must not remain beyond ninety days once their counterparts have been taken, nor may the counterparts remain beyond ninety-five days once their letters have been taken—this is a fixed decree in the Book of God, so that you may be conscious and bear witness that all dominion belongs to God and that all return unto Him. If they remain beyond what God has allotted for them, after they have the capacity and ability, they must spend ninety-five mithqáls of gold; likewise, for women, ninety-five mithqáls of gold—if they can, or if those responsible can. Otherwise, they are absolved. And God has desired nothing but love and contentment for everyone, that you may be grateful in the paradise of the Bayán.

**Indeed, the Eleventh**\
Those who produce a written work shall inscribe at its beginning, “There is no God but God,” and at its end, “There is no proof but upon the one before Muḥammad,” so that on the day of Him Whom God will make manifest you may reason with something akin to this and thus be guided.

**Indeed, the Second after the Ten**\
Your offspring are not bound by the ordinances of your death before the spirit is breathed into them. After the spirit is breathed into them so that they might be born alive, watch over your bounds of life within them. If they emerge stillborn, the ordinances and prayers concerning them are lifted from you. Neither fathers nor mothers shall approach them, lest this cause sorrow—except if there is no one else, as a mercy and favor from God in the Book, so that you may be steadfast in the days of God.

**Indeed, the Third after the Ten**\
In the Bayán, it is permitted for you to become single, one by one, by choosing for yourselves the number of Ḥayy (the Living), so that on the Day of Resurrection, you may present yourselves in that station before God, your Lord. Say: the Point is the sign of the First Tree, and the Living are the signs of the First Living. You must watch over yourselves in that matter so that, on the Day of Resurrection, you may be with Him Whom God will make manifest and with the Living Letters, do not conceal yourselves. For if He Whom God shall make manifest appears in the station of the Point or of the Living, He is certainly the truth from God, with no doubt therein. Truly, we believe in Him altogether.

**Indeed, the Fourth after the Ten**\
God has prescribed for your fathers and mothers to provide for you from the very start of your creation until you complete nineteen full years. And it is incumbent upon you to provide for them until the end of their lives if they are not self-sufficient. Likewise, if they can provide for you, they must do so. You are able to fulfill this as long as you remain on earth, provided that each remains within the bounds of their religion. Should any of them withdraw from these bounds, you are absolved from their obligations. Whoever withdraws from God’s limits in this matter must, every year, spend nineteen mithqáls of gold in the path of God, as a decree in the Book of God, so that you may remain aware.

**Indeed, the Fifth after the Ten**\
Do not ride upon cattle or place any burden upon them, if you believe in God and His signs. Do not drink the milk of donkeys, nor load them—or any other beast—beyond their capacity, as God has prescribed for you, so that you may be conscious. Do not ride an animal except with bridle and stirrups, and do not mount anything on which you cannot safeguard yourselves, for God has sternly prohibited you from that. And do not break an egg upon anything that would spoil its contents before it is cooked. This is what God has designated as the provision for the First Point in the days of Resurrection from His own presence, that you may be thankful.

Whatever appears in the egg as blood is pardoned for you, and it is pure; yet do not eat it, so that you will not bear witness to something displeasing. Do not board the ship except in accordance with your capacity and ownership, and do not dispute or contend while aboard. You must journey among yourselves in the utmost spirit of harmony and fragrance. It is prescribed for those with authority on the ship to place foremost the well-being of those who travel therein whenever it grows turbulent among its passengers, at which time you are unable to stand firm.

Designate the place of your purification in a seat that does not alarm whoever enters it; act just as you do with your privies in other locations. Likewise, do not become overly watchful of purification in the ship beyond what you are able. It has been lifted from those behind the sea, what God ordained for them of obligatory travel if they lack the means for land travel. It is permitted for them to appoint others on their behalf to perform the pilgrimage and deliver their expenses from their location to wherever they must return—if they can do so. Otherwise, they are excused, along with whatever they undertake.

**Indeed, the Sixth after the Ten**\
God has enjoined upon every king of a land one hundred and forty mithqáls of gold each year, and upon the greatest vizier two hundred and ninety mithqáls to be stored for Him Whom God shall make manifest, and at the time of His appearance, they shall deliver it to Him with their own hands. This is so that, in that Resurrection, they will not grieve the Manifestation of their Lord. Perhaps, in return for the deeds of those who came before them, those who remain behind in the Bayán, seated in their places, will act with justice. O you who hear these words, if you do not believe in Him Whom God shall make manifest, do not sadden Him; for in that Resurrection, if these people had believed in the First Point, no one in the Bayán would have been grieved, and all would have journeyed toward the next Resurrection in peace and delight. But they drew a veil over themselves and acquired what God does not love in the Bayán. And you—do not distance yourselves from the mercy of your Lord by acting as they did. If you fail to deliver to Him Whom God shall make manifest what God has decreed for you in the Book, then at least do not grieve Him and do not harbor doubt when you hear the matter.

Make yourselves the arbiters between Him and those who possess the Bayán: submit His verses to those who have the Bayán if you acknowledge your own inability, as well as theirs. Then you will believe; but if you do not admit your own inability or theirs, then do not sadden Him. Even if He were to appear as a judge in that Resurrection to clarify the truth for everyone on earth, nevertheless each group would still return to its own ruling in matters of religion and worldly concerns, making judgments among themselves. Yet they will not manifest a decree by which their faith could be established, something that would testify to their incapacity before the signs of their Lord.

Thus they glorify themselves by that ruling day and night, wearying themselves and exhausting their works, all the while imagining that they are doing good. You who have the Bayán—do not be veiled in the same way.

**Indeed, the Seventh after the Ten**\
O possessors of authority, command those who follow you never to take the clothing or possessions of anyone; if someone is found doing so, then both you and they are forbidden from your spouses for nineteen days. If, despite this, you still unite, you shall owe nineteen mithqáls of gold, to be delivered to the witnesses of the Bayán, who will then give it to the person from whom the clothing or property was taken, so that you may be conscious. Also command those who follow you that no one should ever oppose or confront anyone else—so that on the Day of Resurrection, you will not stand against the companions of Him Whom God shall make manifest. In every land, order that its houses, markets, and places be organized; each type of goods should be kept apart from others, so as not to commingle, unless it is in a place prepared for it. Let every type of goods occupy a single area in a most pleasing arrangement. Command as well that each type be placed in a single caravansary, for that is more conducive to benefit and piety, if you perceive it so.

**Indeed, the Eighth after the Ten**\
Do not command that anything be taken from anyone—not even a hair’s worth—nor that anything be reduced from a person after God has perfected the outward formation of that individual, according to the divine decree recorded in the Book, so that none among you will grieve anyone else. Whoever takes something from another’s body—or alters its color to any degree—or changes their clothing, or intends to degrade them—God has forbidden him from his spouses for nineteen months in the Book of God; and whoever does so must pay, within God’s bounds, ninety-five plus one mithqáls of gold, so that perhaps you may be conscious. Do not command, nor commit, nor approve any such thing; do not oppress anyone by even a mustard seed, if you believe in God and His signs. If you do not believe in God and His signs, then act in a way that does not strip you of your life; for before you were created, you were in God’s sight a drop of water after clay, and you shall return to the palmful of clay. Therefore, be ashamed and never accept for anyone that which you do not accept for yourselves. You are at the height of managing your lives—reflect well, and do not ruin anyone’s existence after God has perfected their creation, simply for the sake of brief worldly prestige or fleeting prosperity. Both will be cut off from you, and afterward you shall enter the Fire, longing as though you had never been created or acquired such deeds that cause sorrow to another. If only you would reason during your lifetime, you would wish you had scarcely perceived.

Say: **The Ninth after the Ten**—No command has God ordained, nor any prohibition revealed, except for the exaltation of Him Whom God shall make manifest. Should He present you with a command or a prohibition, it is His honor, which is God’s honor, that you must regard, and from the totality of both (the prior command and prohibition) you must withdraw.

## Vahid 11

**The Single Eleventh after the Ten**

In the Name of God, the Most Restrained, the Most Holy

Truly, I am God—there is no God but Me—the Most Firm, the Most Firm. I have sent down the measures of all things in the numerical value of “yá” within the One, so that you may be thankful.

**Say: Indeed, in the Single Eleventh after the Ten**, you first bear witness—if you swear by God and then by Him Whom God shall make manifest, and you are truthful between yourselves and God—then no obligation is upon you; and that which you swore regarding shall be returned to you, unless they withhold it. If they do withhold it, they must pay nineteen mithqáls of gold as a fixed decree in the Book of God, so that you may be conscious. But if between yourselves and God your Lord you swear and are not truthful, then you must, as prescribed in the Book of God, pay nineteen mithqáls of gold and return it to whoever was the object of your oath, as a fixed decree in the Book of God, so that you do not swear without right.

**Say: The second**—any king who receives the Bayán must select, from among the inhabitants of his realm, the number of “káf” and “há” from among the learned—those who should be the dawning-places of the letters in the Book of God—so that on the Day of Resurrection they may believe with certainty in Him Whom God shall make manifest, give victory to God’s religion, and make known to all people throughout his realm what is required, so that they may help the weak and show them mercy. Then they shall not hide themselves from God their Lord concerning the limits of their faith.

**Say: The third**—whoever mocks a believing man or believing woman must pay the measure of the One in gold, and then in silver. Then one must utter the word of forgiveness ninety-five times, so that you may be conscious and not mock others. One should return it to the one who was mocked, if able. If one is unable, then the gold and silver are lifted from him, but the obligation to seek forgiveness remains. And if he has no tongue and mocks by his gestures, let him choose someone to seek forgiveness on his behalf. O My servants, be conscious of God.

**Say: The fourth**—Truly, the Bayán and whomever is within it are alive, whether through its light or its fire, until the day of Him Whom God shall make manifest, during which you have power to bring them both to life, then you shall proclaim, and then you shall establish the judgment. Say: Indeed, the fire is for those who draw a veil over the bounds revealed in the Bayán; and the light is for those who observe God’s limits. This is within the Bayán itself, not in the religion into which they have entered. O every thing, be conscious.

**Say: The fifth**—Whoever enters the Bayán, do not drive him away from his faith; and if you do drive him away, you must pay nineteen mithqáls of gold, delivering it to the one you have driven out, as a fixed decree in the Book of God, so that you will not expel anyone from the Bayán. If you bear witness against someone to something for which God has not granted permission in the Bayán, that person has disobeyed God, his Lord, yet has not departed from the foundation of his religion. In proportion to the extent of his veiling, the fire shall reach him. With pleasing and gracious speech, you must make this known to them and remind them.

**Say: The sixth**—Whoever awaits the appearance of Him Whom God shall make manifest without knowing God or seeking His pleasure in understanding His essence and His good pleasure. Such people have not recovered even a single letter of the Bayán, and in the sight of God, they have not been believers. Convey the Book of all things to every soul, even if it be anyone at all, from what remains of the First Wondrous Name, which is a remembrance from God to all the worlds. Then seek forgiveness from God—there is no God but He—the All-Preserving, the Ever-Living—and turn to Him in repentance.

**Say: The seventh**—In the Bayán, you are forbidden to possess more than the measure of the One from any book. If you do possess more, you must pay nineteen mithqáls of gold as a fixed decree in the Book of God, that you may be conscious.

Say: The first is the Bayán itself. Then the Living are the sciences brought forth within the Bayán which are incumbent upon you in your religion, such as grammar, morphology, letters, the enumeration of letters, and whatever you compose in the religion of God through the ways of order, so that you may bring order. Therefore, produce only the essences of knowledge and wisdom, and remain veiled from their embellishments—this is so that, before Him Whom God shall make manifest, nothing will be present except the Bayán itself and whatever has come into being within the Bayán by the measure of the Living, who have attained the pinnacle of knowledge and piety and have been sincere in the religion of God.

**Say: The eighth**—Do not scatter the letters, but gather them in delicate containers or in a gentle cloth. If you guard them otherwise, you are still arranging all letters upon raised places; act so that you may watch over their spirits, so that perhaps, through their spirits, you will attain that which lies in the sublime realms, and remain veiled from all else. Gather together the spirits that are connected thereto within yourselves, so that you will not be dispersed into things that cause you sorrow, but only into what brings you satisfaction and gratitude. And whoever owns any letter must keep it in a cherished station of dignity. If it is in a servant’s chamber, it is incumbent upon each individual to preserve what belongs to them of each written letter, whether placed all in one place or in different seats. God has permitted this for you, so that you do not find the matter difficult.

**Say: The ninth**—Do not sit in the seats of majesty except during the appointed cycle. If you do sit there otherwise, you must pay nineteen mithqáls of gold, unless you are compelled. But whoever compels you must likewise, according to the Book of God, pay what is due, so that you do not depart from the bounds of your proper courtesies. You are permitted to be seated in your houses when your families sit with you, for you cannot always sit around the chambers unless you come together in one place with mutual affection. The requirement regarding seats of mourning has been lifted from you, so that you might grieve for the trusted ones of God.

And if anyone arrives as a guest to another, the host must honor him with inviolable esteem and offer him a place with his own self and those around him. If they fail to do so, then it is incumbent upon all of them to say: “Truly we seek forgiveness from God, Who has the most beautiful names, for all things, and to Him we do indeed return in repentance.”

**Say: The tenth**—Permission has been granted in the Bayán, that all which has been revealed therein be in Arabic, for those who can understand. And if anyone wishes to explain something in Persian, the Book has given leave for those who cannot grasp the words of the Bayán; yet interpret it only with truth. Do not transform the Persian into Arabic unless it is done correctly. And let all of you, collectively, own a beloved Arabic Bayán and a Persian Bayán for those who are unable to comprehend what God has revealed. And you must guard what has been revealed to the Witnesses as you would the apple of your eye, then convey it to Him Whom God shall make manifest.

It is permitted for you to arrange from the “Books of the One” that third portion in a single volume, first all in Arabic, then all in Persian—by God’s mention—so that you may fully encompass the outward sense of all God has revealed in the Book, and then act in accordance with it.

**Then the Eleventh after the Ten**—Do not put yourselves before Him Whom God shall make manifest, nor before the First Living, whether they appear in the highest station of creation or in the lowest, for in God’s sight they are exalted. Whoever steps ahead of them must pay nineteen mithqáls of gold, as a decree in the Book of God, so that you may be conscious.

**Say: The second after the Ten**—You, O people, are the guides of the Cause of God. Whenever you testify against someone that they should be turned away from something, if you can respond, then you must do so; for God answers them according to what He has commanded you, once He has made you aware of someone’s request. It is prescribed that you fulfill it, and if you veil yourselves, then seek forgiveness from God, your Lord, nineteen times. And if you refrain from seeking your own forgiveness, you must pay nineteen mithqáls of gold, as a bound set down in the Book of God, so that you may watch over yourselves. So that whenever any soul appeals to you concerning your religion, you may respond; and concerning the bounds of your world, you may fulfill them as a favor from God upon them, that perhaps you may become the manifestations of how God responds to His servants.

**Say: The third after the Ten**—If a king is raised up in the Bayán, it is ordained for him that he may possess for himself a particular item to place upon his head, one that bears the number ninety-five, which has no equal, no likeness, no match, nor any companion or counterpart, and does not exceed the measure of “hāʾ,” signifying the appearances of His names as a divine honor unto him until the Day of Resurrection. On that day, everything he fashioned by this means in the Bayán shall be ransomed at the feet of Him Whom God shall make manifest, and then you shall prostrate before God. Should you boast of these things, O you who hold dominion—otherwise, God is indeed independent of all the worlds.

**Say: The fourth after the Ten**—Assign from the very start of your night until the end of your day five divisions. At each division, you must call out the adhán. Begin with the start of night, then in the first instance repeat nineteen times “There is no God but God,” followed by the measure of the One, “God is the Most Independent,” then speak it aloud. In the second instance, nineteen times “There is no God but God,” then the measure of the One, “God is the All-Knowing,” say this. In the third instance, nineteen times “There is no God but God,” then the measure of the One, “God is the Most Just,” say this. In the fourth instance, nineteen times “There is no God but God,” then the measure of the One, “God is the Possessor of all,” say this. In the fifth instance, nineteen times “There is no God but God,” then the measure of the One, “God is the Most Powerful,” say this.

And it is prescribed for you that you must give the call to prayer in a place such that those around you can hear. If the sound does not reach someone, that person is required to pay nineteen mithqáls of the purest white sugar each day and night, so that you may watch over yourselves and not veil yourselves from the remembrance of God. Whoever is sleeping is not held accountable; but whoever is short of true sleep must be in a location where they can hear the sound. You are not required to leave your rooms to hear the call; rather, it is sufficient in the Book of God that you have a means for the caller’s voice to reach your dwelling.

If the adhán becomes difficult for the one calling it, let him say once, “God has borne witness that there is no God but He, and that the one whom God shall make manifest is indeed the truth from God. By God’s command, creation proceeds from His presence; indeed, we believe in everything God reveals unto Him.” This is from the bounty of God upon them in their days of cold and times when they cannot endure for long.

**Say: The fifth after the Ten**—If you forget something in your prayer, then make up only that portion which has been missed, not all your actions. The same applies beyond your prayer, for you are absolved in that which came beforehand, and then you need not dwell on it. And by that very same matter already settled, you observe and fulfill. It is decreed for those who have been given the Bayán to let the knowledge of their own selves regarding all that is on earth be reduced to nothing in relation to every king, his daughter, his book, the limits of his dominion, the number of his troops, and the splendor of what he possesses or might possess without parallel—until the day when all shall be presented before God, their Lord.

**Say: The sixth after the Ten**—Do not kill any soul, nor sever anything from a soul, ever, if you believe in God and His signs. Whoever commands or perpetrates such an act, or can prevent it but does not, or is pleased with it, must, according to the Book of God, pay eleven thousand mithqáls of gold to be delivered to the heirs of the victim. Furthermore, all spouses are forbidden to him for nineteen years. This testifies in the Book of God that his very being was created against God’s love and pleasure, and he shall enter the Fire after his death, nor shall God ever forgive him. However, if he abides by these limits and lightens that which has been decreed for him, let him be conscious of God, and then remain so.

If anyone kills another unintentionally, nothing is binding upon him except that the person and the heirs of the one slain must be satisfied, and must grant him pardon, that he might be among those who seek forgiveness before God, his Lord. Such is the case with any circumstance that befalls a person. Therefore, be mindful of God, O every soul, and remain aware.

As for those who committed murders in the land of Ṣād, if they believe in God and His signs, they must take the blood-money for what they have done from the heirs of those killed, according to the limits previously determined, so that you may act with awareness in God’s religion. After this, do not draw near to such acts again.

**Say: The seventh after the Ten**—Whoever orders that someone be driven out of his home, or city, or village, or realm of sovereignty, is forbidden for nineteen months, and must pay nineteen mithqáls of gold, to be returned to him who was driven out, as a fixed decree in the Book of God, so that you may be conscious.

**Say: The eighth after the Ten**—Whoever drinks an intoxicant that removes his senses must pay, in accordance with the Book of God, ninety-five mithqáls of gold. And never treat your sick with any intoxicant if you believe in God and His signs.

**Say: The ninth after the Ten**—Whoever writes even a single letter about Him Whom God shall make manifest, or concerning that which was not revealed in the Bayán before His appearance, must pay nineteen mithqáls of gold according to the Book of God. God has granted no one permission to seize that from him or to question him about it. And whoever does question him concerning that ordinance must incur upon himself the same penalty for having asked about what God did not allow him to ask. Thus be mindful of God, and do not set down so much as a single letter regarding Him Whom God shall make manifest, nor about anything beyond the bounds of what God has revealed prior to the appearance of truth. And do not judge after the appearance as you did before it, imagining you consider yourselves as acting rightly. Yet if you are not writing on behalf of the truth, then do not write anything against the truth. This is what God has counseled you, so that you might be mindful. If you do not support Him Whom God shall make manifest by what you write for Him, then do not be distressed by what is written against Him. Therefore, fear God as He should be feared, so that on the Day of Resurrection, in God’s presence, you may be saved.
